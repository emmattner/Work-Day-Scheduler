# WORK DAY SCHEDULER 

Here I have created a work day scheduler. This can be used to schedule day to day jobs or activities. 

# WHAT DID I LEARN

I further developed my knowledge of local storage abilities whilie implementing a new understanding of jQuery, Bootstrap and DayJS to create a dynamic application.
This application tested my understanding of Third Party API'S in particular DayJS to access the current time and date and jQuery which provides a simplified alternaitve to standard Javascript.
