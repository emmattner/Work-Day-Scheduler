# WORK DAY SCHEDULER 

Here I have created a work day scheduler. This can be used to schedule day to day jobs or activities by writing into the input box and pressing the save button to save to the input into local storage. 

# What did I learn

I further developed my knowledge of local storage abilities whilie implementing a new understanding of jQuery, Bootstrap and DayJS to create a dynamic application.
This application tested my understanding of Third Party API'S in particular DayJS to access the current time and date and jQuery which provides a simplified alternaitve to standard Javascript.
